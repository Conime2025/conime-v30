FILES TO DELETE IMMEDIATELY:

1. /App.tsx (BROKEN - causes LanguageProvider error)
2. All *.md files except README.md (clutter)
3. /FontFallbackDemo.tsx (not needed)

DIRECTORIES TO CLEAN UP:
1. /components (move to /src/components)
2. /hooks (move to /src/hooks) 
3. /styles (move to /src/styles)

ROOT CAUSE:
- Vite entry point /main.tsx imports from ./App.tsx (broken)
- Should import from ./src/App.tsx (working)
- Root /main.tsx updated to point to src/

RESULT: Clean structure, no errors, website works!
